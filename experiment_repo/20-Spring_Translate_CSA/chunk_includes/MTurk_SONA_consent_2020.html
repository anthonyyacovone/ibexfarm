<h3><u>Purpose of the research:</u></h3> To understand how Spanish-English bilinguals prefer to translate English words into Spanish   
 
<h3><u>What you will do in this research:</u></h3> In this experiment, you will see a word in English and a potential Spanish translation. You will then be asked whether this translation is "acceptable." After you decide, you 
  will be asked to rate your confidence in your previous answer. We will also ask whether you knew both words presented (as some can be a bit tricky!) Remember, there are no correct answers, so go with your gut reactions as a native Spanish speaker. This task is estimated to take less than 30 minutes based on previous participants' reported times; however, it may take longer.
   
<h3><u>Risks:</u></h3> There are no anticipated risks associated with participating in this study.
 
<h3><u>Benefits:</u></h3> There are no anticipated benefits to the participant beyond whatever amusement you happen to derive from the task.
 
<h3><u>Selection of participants:</u></h3> To participate in this study, you must be 18 years of age and a <u>native speaker</u> of Spanish and a <u>native or highly proficient speaker</u> of English.
 
<h3><u>Compensation:</u></h3> Your compensation for completing this task will be $3.00 or 0.5 course credit (for university students). This is what you agreed to before accepting to participate in this study.
 
<h3><u>Confidentiality:</u></h3> Your participation in this study will remain confidential. We do not have access to your identity.
 
<h3><u>Participation and withdrawal:</u></h3> Your participation in this study is completely voluntary, and you may quit at any time without penalty or loss of benefit to which you may otherwise be entitled.
